## About

- A web server for the M5Stack that uses markdown text. 

- The web server advertises the webpage IP address, counts and then displays the number of page views.

- Features micro SD / TF card access to display icons on the M5Stack display that are stored on the micro SD / TF card. 

- The full project outline, linked at the bottom of this page, also shows how to make icons for on-screen display and how to convert them into C source files using the included program "Image to Code_59x59px".

## Requirements

- 1x  Quality Micro SD card - 32 Gb size maximum.
- Optional - A markdown editor such as "MarkDownPad2" for editing the markdown text. Only needed if you want to edit the text.

<br />

## Brief Useage Notes

- On startup the M5Stack prompts the user to enter a micro SD card.

- The following files, which are included in the directories above, need to be stored on the micro SD card:

    - Wi-Fi.ini  -  a file with a known Wi-Fi networks
    - style.css  -  a style file    
    - markdown.js  -  a Javascript library that renders Markdown text  -  markdown.js
    - factorial.md  -  a custom markdown file used for this example - replace to customise this project.  

<br />

- The image below shows the webpage displayed to the user. The onscreen text is generated by the *factorial.md* markdown file. The file also includes a web link that pulls the pyramid image from the internet for display on the page.
